# Ticket Booking Application

In your project, you will use the tools of CI/CD from the milestones and Test-driven development (TDD) to design a flight ticket booking application for an airline company. Using additional libraries or online resources in implementing the application should be minimal.

Following are some of the application requirements:

- The application has a web interface.
- The application allows users to book direct or multi-stop flights.
- The application allows users to book a one-way or round trip.
- The application contains only a list of weekly direct flights.
- The application reports the total flight time.
- A 24-hour format is used in the application.
- The ticket may use a 12-hour or 24-hour format per user preferences.
- The application does not produce any cyclic trips from the same airport.
